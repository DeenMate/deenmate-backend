## DeenMate Backend – Project Tracking

Inspector: Cursor (GPT-5)

### Summary
Overall health: In Progress. Core modules (Quran, Prayer, Hadith, Zakat, Audio) are wired with controllers/services, Swagger is live (`/docs`, `/docs-json`), Redis module is implemented and imported, Prisma schema and migrations exist. Schedulers are registered via `@nestjs/schedule` with daily cron entries. Tests are not present yet (Jest runs but finds 0 tests). Database connectivity and data counts not verified in this run (no DB container started during verification); schema is defined for Quran and Prayer including `SyncJobLog` usage in services.

### Module Status
| Module | Status | % Complete | Last Sync | Last Verified | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| Quran | In Progress | 70% | Unknown | 2025-09-04 | Backend | Controllers implemented, services proxy upstream and plan DB sync; cron present. DB counts unverified.
| Prayer | In Progress | 70% | Unknown | 2025-09-04 | Backend | Controllers implemented; services proxy upstream and plan DB sync; cron present. DB counts unverified.
| Hadith | In Progress | 40% | N/A | 2025-09-04 | Backend | Service/controller scaffolded; upstream integration planned; DB schema outlined in docs.
| Zakat | In Progress | 60% | N/A | 2025-09-04 | Backend | Endpoints implemented; relies on external price API.
| Audio | In Progress | 50% | N/A | 2025-09-04 | Backend | Service + controller implemented; storage integration pending.
| Database (Prisma) | In Progress | 70% | N/A | 2025-09-04 | Backend | `schema.prisma` defined; seeds present; migrations exist.
| Redis/Cache | In Progress | 60% | N/A | 2025-09-04 | Backend | `ioredis` client wrapper; cache usage in services; TTL polish pending.
| Scheduler/Workers | In Progress | 60% | Unknown | 2025-09-04 | Backend | `ScheduleModule` enabled; daily crons defined; BullMQ present for workers.
| Swagger/OpenAPI | Done | 100% | N/A | 2025-09-04 | Backend | `/docs` and `/docs-json` are configured; latest exported.
| CI/Tests | Blocked | 10% | N/A | 2025-09-04 | Backend | Jest configured but 0 tests present.

### Sprint Board
Current sprint: Backend Verification and Stabilization
Dates: Sep 01–Sep 14, 2025

- Done: Swagger wiring, Redis module, Prisma schema, cron scaffolds
- In Progress: Proxy parity validation, DB sync, Redis TTL policy
- Blocked: Automated tests missing; DB verification pending container run

### Key Blockers & Risks
- No unit/integration tests discovered; CI cannot assert regressions.
- Database verification not executed (no running Postgres during this pass).
- Scheduler run evidence (`SyncJobLog`) not confirmed; needs DB connectivity.
- Potential parity gaps between implemented controllers and exported Swagger example.

### Next 7-day Plan
- Enable local DB/Redis via docker-compose and run seeds/sync.
- Implement and run a minimal test suite for Quran and Prayer controllers/services.
- Verify cron runs and record `SyncJobLog` entries; add monitoring.
- Finalize Redis TTLs and cache invalidation helpers.
- Close any API parity mismatches vs upstream (Quran.com, Aladhan).

### Audit Evidence
- Verification report: `docs/backend/verification-report.md`
- OpenAPI latest export: `docs/backend/openapi-latest.json`
- Swagger live example: `docs/api/swagger-live.json`
